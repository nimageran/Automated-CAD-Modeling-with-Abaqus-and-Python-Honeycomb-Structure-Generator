## Overview
This project demonstrates the use of Python scripting in Abaqus to automate the creation of 3D honeycomb structures. By leveraging scripting, we can significantly enhance efficiency, accuracy, and customization, while avoiding the tedium of repetitive manual tasks.

## Features
- **Automation of Repetitive Tasks**: Automates the creation of complex and repetitive honeycomb structures.
- **Customization**: Easily modify parameters such as hexagon size, wall thickness, depth, and number of cells to create customized models.
- **Enhanced Accuracy and Efficiency**: Ensures precise alignment and spacing, reducing the risk of human error and speeding up the modeling process.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Abaqus software
- Basic knowledge of Python scripting
